HERO
Your private drivers’ club.
Analog-era performance. Modern classics.
A minimalist, industrial space built for people who love to drive.
ABOUT
Brooklyn Vintage Car Club is a small, private drivers’ club centered on analog, modern-classic cars from the 1990s and 2000s. The emphasis is driving—quiet, minimal, and practical.
A clean industrial space, a curated fleet, frictionless access, and a small membership base that appreciates substance over spectacle.
The space includes a simple lounge with a low-key, self-serve bar, lockers, and room to decompress before or after drives.
Built for people who value engagement, analog feel, and the clarity of mechanical controls.
LOCATION
The club will be located in either Red Hook or Sunset Park—Brooklyn neighborhoods defined by industrial buildings, wide blocks, and easy vehicle access.
Both areas have the right architecture and access for a drivers’ club.
FLEET PHILOSOPHY
A curated set of 90s and 2000s European modern classics—driver-focused machines known for character, engagement, and analog feel.
Launch with 8–10 cars, grow to 12 by the end of year two, and expand to 18 as membership scales.
Representative models include:
Porsche: 964, 993, 996 GT3, 997 Turbo, 944 Turbo
BMW: E36 M3, E46 M3, E39 M5, Z3 M Coupe
Mercedes: CLK63 Black Series
Ferrari: F430
